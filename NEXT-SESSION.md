# Next Session — Resolve Pipeline P7 Follow-ups

## State at handoff (2026-04-22 evening)

**Open PR:** [#21 — Resolve pipeline: split decide→apply→P7→narrate; deterministic effect ordering](https://github.com/good-ancestors/ttx/pull/21)
**Branch:** `t3code/clarify-attempted-versus-happened`
**HEAD:** `33b1ae5` (plus whatever the in-flight UI-reorg agent commits)

### What landed in this session's PR

- **Pipeline split** `rollAndNarrate` → `rollAndApplyEffects` + `continueFromEffectReview` with a mandatory facilitator pause in between (P7 per `docs/resolve-pipeline.md`).
- **R&D growth ordering fix** — growth now lands as phase 9, after the P7 pause, not at start of resolve.
- **multiplierOverride compounding fix** — overrides are now "final value", stashed on `round.pendingMultiplierOverrides`, re-applied after `computeLabGrowth` so they can't escalate (was compounding to 2000×).
- **`EffectReviewPanel`** at `src/components/facilitator/effect-review-panel.tsx` rendering applied + flagged ops from both decide LLM (tagged `(LLM)`) and player actions (tagged `(player action)`, pulled from event log via new `events.getSinceForRound` internal query).
- **Structured NPC sample actions** — `public/sample-actions.json` + mirror in `convex/sampleActionsData.ts`. 4 merger-intent actions on openbrain-ceo / conscienta-ceo rounds 2-4. `src/lib/sample-actions.ts` has the `StructuredIntent` union. `convex/aiGenerate.ts` resolves intents into `mergeLab` on submission + prefers structured samples in the picker.
- **Bug fixes rolled in:** debug-panel model/cost display (`split("/").pop()`), `attempted-panel.tsx` reveal during effect-review (was rendering grey), eslint ignore `.claude/**`.
- **Verification:** 116 tests passing, tsc clean, lint 0 errors, knip clean, 4 live rounds verified.

### Session memory added

- `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_orchestration.md` — rules for checking worktrees before duplicating work, using Sonnet for bulk edits + Opus for tricky decisions, token/context discipline. **Read this first every session.**

## Outstanding work (priority order)

### P0 — Bugs flagged during live testing

1. **Merged-survivor compute routing** — in a live R4 test the merger survivor lab rendered as `OpenBrain 2000× 0u` (the 2000× is fixed now by the override fix, but the `0u` on a survivor that should have absorbed compute is real). Likely one of:
   - Survivor's `ownerRoleId` got cleared during the merge (the `(unowned)` case) so `mergedEntries` emitted no pair transfer in pipeline.ts:782-796.
   - `mergeLabsWithComputeInternal` player-path settlement left the absorbed-owner's compute stranded.
   - Display is mid-pipeline (effect-review) and compute acquisition hasn't happened yet — but other labs showed non-zero stock in the same screenshot.

   **Where to look:** `convex/pipeline.ts:782-796`, `convex/labs.ts#mergeLabsInternal`, `convex/labs.ts#mergeLabsWithComputeInternal`. Reproduce by running a game to R4 with NPC mergers landing (picker is now deterministic).

### P0 — UI requests from user

2. **Full-width sequential facilitator UI** — an in-flight agent (agentId `abace416e585dd3d0`) was launched to do this at end of session. Check its commit. If not landed, the task is: make facilitator view full-width (currently centered narrow), reorder sections so during NARRATE phase the order is: What Was Attempted → What Happened → Lab State → Compute Stock and Flow → Lab Allocations → R&D Progress chart → New Compute Acquired. Last three per explicit user request ("allocations 3rd-last, R&D chart 2nd-last, new-compute last").

   "New Compute Acquired" component **may not exist yet** — build it as a compact per-role list of this round's `acquired` ledger rows. Extract to its own file under `src/components/facilitator/` to keep `round-phase.tsx` under the 740-line max.

3. **Redesign facilitator resolve UI into three narrative sections with progressive reveal** (2026-04-22) — current layout shows Lab State + R&D chart the entire time, which spoils the reveal rhythm. Restructure the resolve/narrate view into three clearly-labelled sections that populate in order as the pipeline progresses:

   **Section 1 — "What was attempted"**
   - Shows the list of player/NPC actions submitted this round.
   - Once dice are rolled, actions migrate into two sub-groups: **Succeeded** and **Failed**.
   - Succeeded ones may carry a flag indicating they need review (today's EffectReviewPanel — a merger, decommission, ownership change, etc. that the facilitator should eyeball). Failed actions just sit grey in the Failed column.

   **Section 2 — "What happened"**
   - Narrative / effect descriptions from the decide LLM + structured effect summaries (merge X into Y, compute +3u, etc.).
   - Also where the narrative-phase text streams in.

   **Section 3 — "Where things are at"** (in this order, top to bottom)
   - **Lab state + allocations** (combined) — one component per lab showing name, R&D multiplier, compute stock, ownership, spec snippet, AND the coloured allocation blocks (deploy/research/safety) that `LabTracker` currently renders separately. Merge today's `WhereWeAreNow` lab cards with `LabTracker` into a single per-lab card. No separate "Lab Allocations" section.
   - **AI capabilities** component — currently missing from the UI after recent changes, needs to be restored. Sits directly below the combined lab state + allocations.
   - Compute stock + flow.
   - R&D multiplier chart (historical trajectory).
   - New compute allocation for this round.

   **Progressive display rule:** Sections 1 and 2 are visible from submit/rolling phases. Section 3 (lab state + R&D chart + new compute) should **only appear late** — once growth + acquisition have landed (i.e. post-P7, during or after narrative). Right now Lab State and R&D show the whole time, which kills the reveal.

   **Hook points:** `src/components/facilitator/round-phase.tsx` (main orchestration, phase gating), `src/components/facilitator/attempted-panel.tsx` (succeeded/failed split — this already exists for reveal, extend it with the review-flag badge), `src/components/facilitator/effect-review-panel.tsx` (fold into the Succeeded column as a flag, not a separate panel), `src/components/facilitator/new-compute-acquired.tsx` (move into Section 3), R&D chart component (check current location — likely under `round-phase.tsx` or a neighbour).

   This is a significant restructure — consider a short Plan agent pass before implementing, and expect to keep `round-phase.tsx` under 700 lines by extracting section components.

   **Step 9 — visual hierarchy + logical-flow review** (do this after all content moves land, before the PR merge). Step back and look at the whole facilitator screen as a facilitator would. Things to check explicitly:
   - **Section peerage**: do S1 / S2 / S3 read as three clearly-labelled siblings, or do internal panel titles ("WHERE WE ARE NOW", "WHAT HAPPENED") compete with the section headers? May need a single section-header band above each section's cards so the three-part structure is obvious at a glance on a projection.
   - **Spacing rhythm**: consistent card padding, consistent gap between sibling cards inside a section vs. gap between sections. Today each section is a stack of independent cards; consider whether sections should have a visible bounding wrap (subtle border or background tint) to group related cards.
   - **Progressive reveal beat**: when phase transitions submit → rolling → effect-review → narrate, do sections appear in order without layout jank? No unmount-remount flicker on the narrative panel? Section 3's pop-in after Continue should feel like a reveal, not a jump.
   - **Applied Effects placement**: currently lives as a separate card under the narrative. Decide: (a) second card under narrative (today), (b) collapsed summary-by-default with a "show effects" toggle, or (c) inlined into the narrative card as a sub-section. (a) is simplest; (b) reduces noise during narrate; (c) tightest but highest churn.
   - **Allocation block scale**: `ComputeDotsViz` renders 1 block per compute unit. At 200u+ this becomes a large rectangle and dominates the lab card. Consider capping to 50 blocks with a "×N" multiplier label, or switching to a proportional bar at high counts.
   - **Narrate-only R&D chart vs. always-on before**: the chart used to be always-visible below the fold. Now gated to `narrate`. Confirm this is the right call for facilitators who want to glance at trajectory during submit/rolling — maybe the chart should appear during submit/rolling too, just without the current-round dot. Decide.
   - **Debug panel position**: DebugPanel is still at the bottom. Confirm it's below Section 3 in the new layout and doesn't visually break the section hierarchy.
   - **Projector view**: load `?projector=true` and sanity-check. Many of the facilitator-only UIs (Continue bar, Edit narrative, merge buttons, regenerate) should be absent. No clipped content, no tiny text.

   Only after this polish pass should the PR be marked ready.

### P1 — Follow-ups explicitly deferred from the resolve-pipeline.md plan

3. **Richer P7 flag surface** — current `appliedOps[].type === "rejected"` uses freeform strings. Replace with typed categories: `conflict`, `precondition_failure`, `invalid_reference`, `low_confidence_extraction`. Severity-ordered display. Hook points: `convex/pipeline.ts` rejection sites (merge/decommission/transfer/compute/multiplier validators), `src/components/facilitator/effect-review-panel.tsx`.

4. **Structured action vocabulary on grader output** — per `docs/resolve-pipeline.md` phase 2, grader should emit `{probability, structuredEffect, confidence}` per action. Today grader only emits `probability + reasoning`. Adding `structuredEffect` would let us replace the decide LLM with deterministic extraction (phase 5 derives ops from grader output, no second LLM call). Big change — split into its own PR.

5. **Split `labOperation` type into a discriminated union** — current shape at `convex/pipeline.ts:524` is a flat type with every field optional. Make it `{type: "merge", survivor, absorbed, newName?, spec?} | {type: "decommission", labName} | ...`. Mechanical refactor.

### P2 — Code quality

6. **`round-phase.tsx` too long** — 740 lines, above the 700-line warning. Extract at least:
   - `AdvanceRound` / `EndScenario` buttons into their own component.
   - The effect-review integration point is already extracted; continue with the narrate-phase bottom bar.

7. **Sample action generator script** — `convex/sampleActionsData.ts` says "DO NOT EDIT — auto-generated" but there's no script. Either write a `scripts/generate-sample-actions-data.mjs` that does `fs.readFile("public/sample-actions.json") → writeFile("convex/sampleActionsData.ts", ...)` or update the header to say "maintained in sync by hand" and add a test that asserts equality.
